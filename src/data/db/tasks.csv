"AREA","NAME","DESCRIPTION"
"NLP Benchmark","Text Categorization by Topic","Text Categorization by Topic is the task of assigning a sentence or document an appropriate category. The categories depend on the chosen dataset and can range from topics."
"NLP Benchmark","NER","Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of tagging entities in text with their corresponding type. Approaches typically use BIO notation, which differentiates the beginning (B) and the inside (I) of entities. O is used for non-entity tokens."
"NLP Benchmark","Machine Translation","Machine translation is the task of translating a sentence in a source language to a different target language"
"Additional tasks and Resources","Tokenization","Tokenization is the process of breaking a stream of text up into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens. The list of tokens becomes input for further processing such as parsing or text mining."
"Additional tasks and Resources","Sentence Segmentation","Sentence segmentation is the task of splitting a sentence into its component phrases."
"Additional tasks and Resources","Lemmatization","Lemmatization is the process of identifying the lemma of a given word or sequence of words."
"Additional tasks and Resources","POS Tagging","Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) is the task of tagging a word in a text with its part of speech. A part of speech is a category of words with similar grammatical properties."
"Additional tasks and Resources","Dependency Parsing","Dependency parsing is the task of extracting a dependency parse of a sentence that represents its grammatical structure and defines the relationships between ""head"" words and words, which modify those heads."
"NLP Benchmark","Language Modeling","Language modeling is the task of predicting the next word or character in a document."
"NLP Benchmark","Question Answering","Question Answering (QA) systems enable users to retrieve exact answers for questions posed in natural language. This task covers all QA systems for Romanian, with datasets that contain in-domain training data as well as zero-shot cross-linugal datasets."
"NLP Benchmark","Sentiment Analysis","A sentiment analysis system combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and/or categories within a phrase, sentence or document."
"NLP Benchmark","Semantic Textual Similarity","Semantic textual similarity deals with determining how similar two sentences or documents are. Similarity can be measured as an interval, like 1 (no relation between two texts) to 5 (the two texts fully convey the same meaning). Standard dataset measures include Pearson and Spearman correlations."
"NLP Benchmark","Cross-domain POS Tagging","Part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) is the task of tagging a word in a text with its part of speech. A part of speech is a category of words with similar grammatical properties."
"NLP Benchmark","Cross-domain Dependency Parsing","Dependency parsing is the task of extracting a dependency parse of a sentence that represents its grammatical structure and defines the relationships between ""head"" words and words, which modify those heads."
"NLP Benchmark","Gender debiasing","Gender debiasing is the task of reducing bias Ã®n Romanian word embeddings."
