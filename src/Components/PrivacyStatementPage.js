    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
    <p>
      LiRo Benchmark Project aims to process as little personal data as possible, and only in accordance with the data
      privacy principles and regulations (in particular, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)).
    </p>

    <p>
      We are an independent structure of pro-bono volunteers with expertise in Machine Learning, NLP, linguistics and
      data privacy and our goal is to accelerate progress in AI research on Romanian language (referred to as “we”,
      “our”, “controller”).
    </p>
    <p>This Privacy Statement applies to any person involved in the LiRo Benchmark Project.</p>

    <h2>What personal data do we process? For which purposes do we process such data?</h2>

    <h3>If you are a user of the Benchmark, Leaderboard or Starter Code, we process the following:</h3>
    <p>As far as we are concerned, you can submit your model without providing us any personal data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        However, in order to be able to allocate the tasks’ performance to your model and to maintain a record of such
        activities, we will process personal data in the form of certain unique identifiers used by our systems only for
        this purpose (e.g., user ID, GitHub ID).
      </li>
      <li>
        Also, depending on the results of your model and on how we will develop further LiRo Benchmark Project (e.g., as
        an award-based competition) we may ask you to provide us with certain personal data in the form of
        identification details (e.g., name, surname) and contact details (e.g., email, phone number). We will use such
        identification details and contact details only in order to be able to contact you for functional enquiries
        (e.g., errors on models, additional questions on performance etc.) or to contact you for granting the award.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We will process your personal data based on our legitimate interest to perform scientific research regarding the
      acceleration of progress in AI on Romanian language (article 6 (1) f) GDPR), or as it is necessary for the
      performance of our obligations to you (article 6 (1) b) GDPR). If you refuse to provide us with the personal data
      necessary for functional enquiries or for award granting, we will not be able to provide you with such benefits.
    </p>

    <h3>If your personal data is found in the datasets, we process the following:</h3>
    <p>
      We will process the personal data found in the datasets only in order to develop tasks, track performance of
      different models on such datasets and compute metrics out of such performance. We will use only personal data that
      has been made public for information purposes, and we will further process it only for scientific research
      purposes that are deemed compatible with the initial purposes (article 5 (1) b) GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of such datasets are - RONEC (Romanian Named Entity Corpus) and Romanian RRT Treebank. In the near
      future, we would like to obtain datasets from news agencies, and we will update this section as soon as possible.
      For specific details regarding the datasets used, please access the designated section on our website.
