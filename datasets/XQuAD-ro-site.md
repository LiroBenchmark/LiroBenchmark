**XQuAD** (Cross-lingual Question Answering Dataset) is a benchmark dataset for evaluating cross-lingual question answering performance. The dataset consists of a subset of 240 paragraphs and 1190 question-answer pairs from the development set of SQuAD v1.1 together with their professional translations into Spanish, German, Greek, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Hindi and *Romanian*. Consequently, the dataset is entirely parallel across all languages. The target is to evaluate QA performance on the Romanian section of the corpus, by cross-lingual transfer (e.g. zero-shot on the Romanian data after being trained on one or more languages from the corpus excluding Romanian).
