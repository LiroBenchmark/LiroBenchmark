The **Wiki-ro** corpus consists of cleaned text extracted from the Romanian Wikipedia. This corpus is meant to test the capacity of a Language Model (LM) by measuring its perplexity on the test set after being trained solely on the training data. LMs pretrained on external data can be tested as well, but will have the flag marking their out-of-domain pretraining.
