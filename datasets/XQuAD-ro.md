### Input, Output and Metrics:

XQuAD is intended as an evaluation corpus for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. Evaluation on the test data should ideally only be conducted at the very end of the experimentation in order to avoid overfitting to the data.

Please see this [resource](https://github.com/deepmind/xquad) to understand more about XQuAD evaluation.

Metrics reported: **Macro-averaged F1 score** and **Exact Match**.
