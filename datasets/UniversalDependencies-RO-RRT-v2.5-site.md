**Universal Dependencies** ([UD](https://universaldependencies.org/)) is a framework for consistent annotation of grammar across different human languages, and the **Romanian RRT v2.5** is the [standard treebank](https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/ro_rrt/index.html) for the Romanian language.

The treebank contains over 200K tokens, and is composed of annotated sentences belonging to a set of different genres. On this dataset the following tasks can be performed: **tokenization**, **sentence segmentation**, **lemmatization**, **part-of-speech tagging** and **dependency parsing**.
