The Romanian word embeddings are fastText Wikipedia supervised word embeddings included in the [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE) library. The first 1 million embeddings are loaded. A list of feminine and masculine Romanian nouns are used that were selected based on the most frequent feminine and masculine nouns that appear in the Wikipedia dump of July 2020. The first most frequent 3000 feminine and masculine nouns that are present in the loaded 1 million embeddings are used in the experiments.
The embeddings file used is added to the [embeeding_ro](https://github.com/LiroBenchmark/gender-bias/tree/main/embeddings_ro) directory, while the selected feminine and masculine nouns are listed in the [data_ro](https://github.com/LiroBenchmark/gender-bias/tree/main/data_ro) directory.
