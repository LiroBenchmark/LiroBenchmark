The Romanian word embeddings are fastText Wikipedia supervised word embeddings included in the [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE) library. 
A list of feminine and masculine Romanian nouns selected based on their frequency in the [wiki-ro](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/wiki-ro) corpus is used for the experiments. The first 3000 most frequently used nouns are selected for both genders.

The embedding file used is included in [embeddings_ro](https://github.com/LiroBenchmark/gender-bias/tree/main/embeddings_ro) directory, while the selected feminine and masculine nouns are listed in the [data_ro](https://github.com/LiroBenchmark/gender-bias/tree/main/data_ro) directory.
