The Romanian word embeddings are fastText Wikipedia supervised word embeddings included in the [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE) library. The first 1 million embeddings are loaded. A list of feminine and masculine Romanian nouns are used selected based on the most frequent feminine and masculine nouns that appear in the Romanian Wikipedia dump of July 2020. The first most frequent 3000 feminine and masculine nouns that are present in the loaded 1 million embeddings are used in the experiments.
The embedding file used is included in [embeddings_ro](https://github.com/LiroBenchmark/gender-bias/tree/main/embeddings_ro) directory, while the selected feminine and masculine nouns are listed in the [data_ro](https://github.com/LiroBenchmark/gender-bias/tree/main/data_ro) directory.
