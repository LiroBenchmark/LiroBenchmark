Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) is a conference that builds on a series of annual workshops and conferences on
statistical machine translation, going back to 2006. In 2016, a dataset for Romanian-English translation was proposed, containing approximately 614k of parallel sentences taken from Europarl and SETTIMES2.
