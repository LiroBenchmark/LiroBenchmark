### Description:

MOROCO, the Moldavian and Romanian Dialectal Corpus, contains Moldavian and Romanian samples of text collected from the news domain. The samples belong to one of the following six topics: culture, finance, politics, science, sports, tech. The data set is divided into three subsets: training (21719 samples), validation (5921 samples), test (5924 samples).

### Input, Output and Metrics:

The task is to classify each news article into one of the six classes. Given the training and validation sets, the target is to maximize the macro-averaged F1 score on the test set. 

The reported metric is the **Macro-averaged F1 score**.
