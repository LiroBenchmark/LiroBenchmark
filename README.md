# LiRo - Romanian Benchmark Leaderboard

[LiRo (Limba Română)](https://lirobenchmark.github.io/) provides an open benchmark for Romanian language tasks, available at [lirobenchmark.github.io/](https://lirobenchmark.github.io/).

The project keeps track of performance of different published models on the datasets and tasks listed below. This allows easy comparison of different models and monitoring progress on these tasks and datasets over time.

### New model and datasets submissions

We encourage submissions of both new models on existing tasks as well as new datasets! The [submission process](SUBMIT_NEW_MODEL.md) is open and transparent, just open a new issue with the appropriate template and fill in your model details and performance on your target tasks.
